"I'm an experienced devops engineer.  Heroes of Might and Magic III has "
"always been one of my favourite games.  That's why when a board game "
"crowdfunding was announced, I backed it in a heartbeat.  I helped create "

"com/Heegu-sama/Homm3BG), [Fan-Made Mission Book](https://github.com/qwrtln/"
"Homm3BG-mission-book), and the [game wiki](https://homm3bg.wiki/)."
