"For the first time, I decided not to follow the colors on the card, as they "
"were too vibrant.  An actual peasant would likely wear more muted clothing — "
"violet shirts wouldn’t be in their wardrobe.  The mini ended up with earthy, "
"autumn-inspired tones."

"I used a flat brown for the base of the trousers, pitchfork, and cap, but "

"handle."

"The shirt and the ground were too similar in color, making the mini hard to "

"color I usually use for zombie skin.  Even this subdued color helped the "

"The pitchfork was painted with gunmetal, with silver edges, and a touch of "
