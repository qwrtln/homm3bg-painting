"Green skin is supposedly easier to paint than human skin.  Well, that crusty "
"texture was not as straightforward (it involved some wonky dry-brushing).  "
"Nevertheless, those yellow-tinted highlights turned out really well.  This "
"was also my first attempt at painting facial details like eyeballs and "
"teeth.  I'm really glad it worked out on the first try."
