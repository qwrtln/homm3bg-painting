# Gold Golem

Painting muscles with metallics is a very rewarding experience - the gold catches light beautifully and accentuates the sculpted physique.

### The Plan

Most of the mini will be covered with metallics, which shine on their own.
The usual zenithal priming helps bring out all the details of the mini.

The hands are too pale, but other than that all the details are clearly visible.

The Pharaoh never skipped the leg day.

### The Process

I started with covering the upper body with AK's old gold, then a layer of Reikland Fleshshade to darken the recesses, and then a final layer of Vallejo's gold.

Those simple steps already make the golem's "skin" look good.

With Pharaoh clothes, one needs to be very careful with the fine details.
I chose my thinnest synthetic brush for this task.
Blue with azure for highlights for one part, gold for everything else.

For the pants, I used the same colors as for the cap, with one difference: I opted for Agrax Earthshade to give it some depth.

With metallics, it's more difficult to make an even layer, into which wash can flow.

What was left, was the sand base.
Dry-brushing and stippling helped give the sand texture and a consistent tone.

A final look helps find places to fix. Look at the collar - metallics overspilled a little.

### Conclusion

Key learnings:

- Painting with metallics is rather straightforward.
No wonder people opt for Non-Metallic Metal.

- Don't use your best brushes with metallics!
Natural fur gets damaged all too easily.
