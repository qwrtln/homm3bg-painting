Lessons learned from the begining of the adventure.

Even amateur painting quality is better than bare plastic.
It makes you want to play even more.

Quick math: it took me about 3 months to paint 7 miniatures.
At this pace, painting the whole game will take roughly 3 years.
Let's see if this prediction holds true.

Key takeaways so far:

 - Artistry like this follows specific rules that anyone can learn.
 Following these rules will lead to decent results.

 - No need to sweat over the details or quality, as long as you're having fun.
 Time flows surprisingly fast when you're laser-focused on completing the next miniature.

 - Online video tutorials have limited value unless they demonstrate painting something very similar to your project (so far I've found [one YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/@olebrogger/search?query=heroes) who does this).
 Most tutorial creators use premium-quality miniatures and equipment that I either can't access or don't want to invest in.
 Naturally, their tutorials wouldn't look as spectacular if they used lower-quality materials.

 - A quality paintbrush is the most crucial piece of equipment.
While you can compromise on other materials, a poor-quality brush will limit your progress.

 - If you have a scientific mind and are new to artistic work, this hobby will challenge your brain in a positive way.
You'll develop skills from parts of your mind that don't get much exercise normally.
It's like the reverse of teaching a creative friend how to code.

I hope this helps.
Pick up that brush and see where it takes you.
