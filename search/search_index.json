It makes you want to play even more.</p> <p>Quick math: it took me about 3 months to paint 7 miniatures. At this pace, painting the whole game will take roughly 3 years. Let's see if this prediction holds true.</p> <p>Key takeaways so far:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Artistry like this follows specific rules that anyone can learn.  Following these rules will lead to decent results.</p> </li> <li> <p>No need to sweat over the details or quality, as long as you're having fun.  Time flows surprisingly fast when you're laser-focused on completing the next miniature.</p> </li> <li> <p>Online video tutorials have limited value unless they demonstrate painting something very similar to your project (so far I've found one YouTuber who does this).  Most tutorial creators use premium-quality miniatures and equipment that I either can't access or don't want to invest in.  Naturally, their tutorials wouldn't look as spectacular if they used lower-quality materials.</p> </li> <li> <p>A quality paintbrush is the most crucial piece of equipment. While you can compromise on other materials, a poor-quality brush will limit your progress.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you have a scientific mind and are new to artistic work, this hobby will challenge your brain in a positive way. You'll develop skills from parts of your mind that don't get much exercise normally. It's like the reverse of teaching a creative friend how to code.</p> </li> </ul> <p>I hope this helps.
